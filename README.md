## Introduction

This repository is designed to help me understand and practice essential Git concepts like version control, branching, merging, working with remote repositories, and more. I will be documenting the steps I take, the mistakes I make, and the lessons I learn along the way.

## Goals

1. Understand the basics of Git (staging, committing, etc.)
2. Learn how to create and manage branches
3. Practice merging and resolving conflicts
4. Work with remote repositories (push, pull, fetch)
5. Explore advanced Git features (rebasing, cherry-picking, etc.)

## Basic Git Workflow

Here’s a simple workflow I’m following to get comfortable with Git commands:

1. **Clone a repository**:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/mayankkorat/test2.git

Commit 1
